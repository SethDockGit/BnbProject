# BnbProject

A full-stack "Bed N Breakfast" rental website using React, a C# WebAPI and logic layer, and a SQL database. Features include a user profile page for management of the user's listings, stays, and favorites, a listings page to display listings available for booking with filters for availability, price, and amenities, as well as a 5 star rating and review system, a booking mechanism that controls for available dates, a user account and authentication system using local data storage, and more. This application uses MaterialUI elements to display these features, including an option for users to upload images to be stored along with their listing in the SQL database. It implements unit testing for the logic layer, and includes a creation script with test data for the SQL database.
